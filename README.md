# lambda_function

### Serverless Architecture

-> I have created a lambda_handler function implementing Basic authentication Register/Login

-> On top of serverless deployment, I have also used API gateway as my center of control to redict my RestApi

-> This is just a prototype for serverless many important features like tokenization, Better Hashing, Handling Edge cases,
  Making code more Optimized, implementing security measures , Authorization can be applied.
